This project was the first project included in the 100 Days of SwiftUI tutorial! Previously, I was just challenge problems using Swift Playgrounds (which I also uploaded to my github!) Most of the code was given by the tutorial except for the 3 challenges that were given below. That is my own code!

Included in this repository will be a screenshot and a video of the app in action!

CHALLENGE:
Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
Change the tip percentage picker to show a new screen rather than using a segmented control, and give it a wider range of options – everything from 0% to 100%. Tip: use the range 0..<101 for your range rather than a fixed array.
